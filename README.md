# CS-255-System-Analysis-Design

These documents demonstrate my ability to collect requirements from customers and design a system that meets those needs

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
Client: The client is DriverPass, an organization focused on enhancing driver training.

System Design: They wanted an online system to provide practice exams, lesson reservations, and on-the-road training. The goal is to reduce the high failure rate in DMV driving tests by equipping students with comprehensive training tools.

What did you do particularly well?
I effectively identified the core components and requirements of the DriverPass system, ensuring it addresses the user’s needs. The clear separation of functional and nonfunctional requirements allows for focused development and assessment.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of the documents, I would enhance the User Interface section. I would include more details on user experience design principles, such as usability testing and user feedback mechanisms, to ensure the interface is intuitive and engaging.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs through thorough analysis of their challenges, like the high failure rates in driving tests. By incorporating features like online practice tests and flexible scheduling,
I ensured the system aligns with users’ preferences and learning styles. Understanding user needs is crucial because it drives the design process, ensuring the system is user-centric and effective in addressing real problems.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach software design using user-centered design principles. This involves:
-Gathering Requirements: Conducting interviews or surveys to understand user needs.
Prototyping- Creating wireframes or prototypes to visualize the system and gather feedback early.
Iterative Development- Using agile methodologies to allow for continuous improvement based on user feedback.
Testing- Implementing usability tests to refine the interface and functionalities.

In the future, I would emphasize involving users throughout the design process to ensure their needs are consistently met and to foster a more successful final product.
